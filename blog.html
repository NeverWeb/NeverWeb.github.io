		<h3>The Beginning - 2/13/18</h3>
<p> As I sit here pondering, I can’t help but feel I should begin recording my thoughts and ideas in the hopes that they outlive me. My name is Dawn. It isn’t my real name of course, but it’s the name you’ll come to know me by. I live in Washington. I’m currently in Running Start at Centralia College with my girlfriend. Her and I both have gotten accepted to our ideal college, Western Washington University. Although times have often been rough, we have strived to do our best and have made it through our first two years of college. If all goes well, both of us will have our degrees in another two years. I hope to land a job in Software Engineering or something similar. She hopes to be a professor of Humanities and Archeology. We hope to get married soon after college and live happy lives with the family we plan to raise. Everything seems to be perfectly set in place, and yet I can’t help but feel incredibly uneasy of the times ahead. Will we land our dream jobs and live a happy, healthy life? Or will we fail and spiral into a depression that we can never recover from? I believe recording my personality and thoughts will assist me in organizing them in the most effective way. There will be no schedule to my posts. They will come as needed.</p>
